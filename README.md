# RabbitMQ Tutorial

This project runs multiple containers via docker-compose.
	- a RabbitMQ broker from an official image
	- a RabbitMQ python client build from a local Dockerfile

The local Dockerfile, which is based on a python devcontainer image,
defines the development environment for the python client(s).

## Start with VS Code

Run VS code in the root of this repo, open the command prompt (F1), and
select `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`
